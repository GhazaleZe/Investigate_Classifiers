# Investigate_Classifiers
The point is to investigate three types of classifiers (linear classifier with feature selection, linear classifier without feature selection, and a non-linear classifier) in a setting where precision and interpretability may matter.

**All the codes for investigating classifier is in main.py.**


There is Mushroom notebook that has most of the outputs of the main.py codes.
